### Assignment 1: Backup Strategies – Comparing RMAN and User-Managed Backups

##### Objective: 
-   Understand the advantages, disadvantages, and use cases of different Oracle backup strategies.

**Tasks:**

1. Compare RMAN vs. User-Managed Backups in terms of features, ease of use, and recovery capabilities.
2. Research when to use full, incremental, and differential backups and provide real-world scenarios where each is preferable.
3. Analyze backup storage considerations – how does backup strategy impact disk space, backup duration, and system performance?
4. Write a case study on a failed database recovery due to poor backup management and suggest an improved strategy.

**Deliverables:**

- A comparative report (table format preferred) listing pros/cons of each backup approach.
- A short case study with recommendations on improving a backup plan.

### Assignment 2: Difference Between Restore, Recover, and Flashback Techniques

##### Objective: 
-   Distinguish between restore, recover, and flashback techniques, and understand when to use each.

**Tasks:**

1. Define RESTORE, RECOVER, and FLASHBACK and explain how they function.
2. Compare Flashback Database, Flashback Query, Flashback Table, and Flashback Drop – when and how should each be used?
3. Research a scenario where point-in-time recovery (PITR) is necessary and explain why flashback may or may not be an option.
4. Explain how flashback logging affects system performance and storage.

**Deliverables:**

A detailed report comparing these concepts, including real-world scenarios for each.
A decision matrix on when to use flashback vs. recovery techniques.

### Assignment 3: Comparing Physical and Logical Backup – Use Cases and Trade-offs

##### Objective: 
-   Differentiate between physical backups (RMAN, Datafile backups) and logical backups (Data Pump, Export/Import) and analyze their best use cases.

**Tasks:**

1. Explain the differences between physical and logical backups in terms of structure, advantages, and disadvantages.
2. Research use cases where a logical backup is preferred over a physical backup and vice versa.
3. Investigate how Data Pump Export and Import work and whether they can be used for disaster recovery.
4. Identify limitations of Data Pump when dealing with large databases and discuss performance considerations.

**Deliverables:**

- A comparative analysis between physical vs. logical backups in table format.
- A report on best practices for choosing the right backup strategy based on business requirements.


### Assignment 4: High Availability Solutions – Data Guard vs. Real Application Clusters (RAC)

##### Objective: 
-   Compare Oracle’s high availability solutions and analyze when to use Oracle Data Guard vs. Real Application Clusters (RAC).

**Tasks:**

1. Explain what Data Guard and RAC are and how they provide high availability.
2. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each in terms of:
   -   Cost
   -   Complexity
   -   Performance
   -   Disaster Recovery
   -   Downtime reduction
3. Identify real-world scenarios where Data Guard would be preferred over RAC and vice versa.
4. Research the impact of using Active Data Guard instead of traditional standby databases.

**Deliverables:**

- A detailed report comparing Data Guard and RAC with a decision-making flowchart.
- A business case study analyzing which solution fits better for an organization.

### Assignment 5: Performance Tuning – Optimizing Redo and Undo for Recovery

##### Objective: 
-   Understand how redo logs and undo tablespaces affect recovery and performance in Oracle.

**Tasks:**

1. Explain the purpose of Redo Logs and Undo Tablespaces in Oracle.
2. Differentiate between Online Redo Logs, Archived Redo Logs, and Flashback Logs – how does each impact recovery?
3. Research best practices for configuring Redo Logs to improve performance and minimize data loss.
4. Compare Undo Tablespace vs. Temporary Tablespace – how do they differ in recovery scenarios?
5. Investigate how Redo Log contention affects database performance and propose solutions.

**Deliverables:**

- A technical report analyzing redo and undo strategies for recovery and performance tuning.
- A flowchart or diagram explaining how redo logs, undo tablespaces, and archived logs work together in recovery.
